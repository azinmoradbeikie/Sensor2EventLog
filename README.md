# Sensor2EventLog
knowledge-guided framework that transforms raw sensor data into process-aware event logs by incorporating Machine Teaching (MT) principles. The core of the framework is a modular abstraction layer embedded in an interactive teaching loop (planning, explaining, and reviewing) where human experts map sensor behaviors correspond to process states.
